        <h1>Zum Bubble Gum</h1>

        <div class="description">
            Zum is a brand of intensely flavoured bubble gum not for the faint hearted. The packaging is designed to be bold and eye-catching, with a strong emphasis on the flavour of the gum. I was hired to develop the packaging and illustration, with a placeholder for the logo. The packaging is designed to be easily recognisable and stand out on the shelf. It was designed in collaboration with an entrepreneur for a project of theirs, as part of my freelance activities.
