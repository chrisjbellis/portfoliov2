            This was a personal project to design a FitBit app concept for skateboarders - a smartphone game that uses machine learning to understand skateboard tricks. Alongside the app, I used Arduino to prototype a bluetooth connected accelerometer that attaches to the skateboard â€“ providing data for point scoring tricks and the ability to view past performances via a generated 3D animation of the skateboard. 
            
            <p>Features include: Real world movement data such as height, shape and distance of tricks performed; daily customised statistics such as land rate, maximum trick altitude, best trick sequence etc; daily challenges; follow other skaters to compare statistics and complete challenges together. I developed the entire UI and UX, including all the iconography.
