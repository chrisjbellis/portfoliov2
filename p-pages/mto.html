        <h1>MTO Furniture</h1>

        <div class="description">
            MTO is a furniture brand based in Bournemouth. I was asked to design some 3D stills of concept furniture for a social media advert, and add some simple animation. I've include this in the graphics section of my portfolio, rather than the motion design section, because the work was predominantly focussed on the static design of the 3D model, lighting and textures. Both the static stills and the animated clip can be seen below.
