        <h1>Elanza Fresh</h1>

        <div class="description">
            Elanza Fresh is an organic fruit grower and distributor based in New Zealand. They needed a refresh of their packaging so that it used only two colours, plus the colour of the cardboard box. They already had the trapezoid shaped packaging with the cut out leaf locked in, so the design had to fit within these parameters while aligning with their branding.
