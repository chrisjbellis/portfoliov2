        <h1>The Pedagogical Utility of Destruction</h1>

        <h2>An Exploration of Inuit Making Practices</h2>

        <div class="description">

                  Inuit communities in North America live in some of the most challenging environments on Earth:
                the cold, desolate Artic. To survive, the Inuit construct artefacts such as clothing and shelter that while protecting the human inside, must withstand those same conditions that they protect the human from. This seems self evident, until we consider the nature of the materials and processes that the inuit use to construct their clothing. Jackets tolerate a barrage from nature and are further bruised as the Inuit use them to live. A caribou skin glove suffers a beating as an Inuit elder seeks, shoots and snares yet another lone caribou. And an igloo, made from <i>ice</i>, triumphs while a storm prevails and a <i>fire</i> burns fierce inside. However,
                although these artefacts are made from materials that in their raw state would quickly perish, they resist torture to their very limits. 
                
                <p>The perpetuation of this fragile existence is a testing ground for
                the most resilient of making practices that through an intimate entanglement with their resources, manufacture durable artefacts that contradict the attributes of the unprocessed materials and their environments. Moreover, they achieve this durability with a procedure that resembles something I can only  describe as destruction. In this essay, I seek to decipher this complex, bizarre, paradoxical entanglement between the human and material, while describing how contemporary ecological designers can learn from these techniques by grappling with failure as an insurance policy.
