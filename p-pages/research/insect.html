        <h1>Barriers to Entomophagy in the UK</h1>

        <h2>A review of the barriers to entomophagy in the UK from a social, environmental and technological perspective.</h2>

        <div class="description">

            Entomophagy (the consumption of insects by humans for food) is widely accepted by food and sustainabilty scientists to be a highly sustainable animal protein source – requiring as little as 1/10th or less of the resource impact for conventional animal agriculture such as cattle farming, for the same amount of protein. However, there are numerous barriers to entomophagy in the UK, despite two billion people globally eating insects on a daily basis. This is rooted in a number of issues, including "western" attitudes to food, notions of disgust, as well as technological barriers linked to a lack of appropriate policy and knowledge regarding the safe farming of insects on a vast scale.

            <p>In this essay, I conducted a literature review of the current knowledge on the topic, in preparation for future design led research and intervention.
